This repository contains the computational data for a hugh variety of different calculations of Sodium ions including hard carbon based sytems. It includes optimized geometries and Interaction energy output files for each graphene based structure, as well as the input files, basis sets, and potential files used for the calculations. This data is provided to enable reproducibility of the Interaction energies between Sodium ion and graphene based systems and binding energies of the 1s core electron of carbon.
